# houdini_timesaver_kit
Tools for houdini which will hopefully speed up your workflow and free you from annoying, repetitive tasks.

you will need to have the olts/hdas from the "otls" folder installed on your computer in order to make the tools work.
After that, simply drop the shelf from the shelftools into your toolbars folder and you will find it in the shelftools-dropdown after restarting houdini.
